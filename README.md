# PrusaSlicer-MultiTool

**This is a fork of PrusaSlicer that removes various warnings related to multi-toolhead operation, such as blocking wipe towers with mismatching nozzle sizes, even if the layer height is a sane number.**  *This will likely cause tons of issues unless you are watching closely and have a specific use case in mind.  Caveat emptor!*

You may want to check the upstream [PrusaSlicer project page](https://www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/).
Prebuilt Windows, OSX and Linux binaries are available through the [git releases page](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases) or from the [Prusa3D downloads page](https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/). There are also [3rd party Linux builds available](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/wiki/PrusaSlicer-on-Linux---binary-distributions).

PrusaSlicer takes 3D models (STL, OBJ, AMF) and converts them into G-code
instructions for FFF printers or PNG layers for mSLA 3D printers. It's
compatible with any modern printer based on the RepRap toolchain, including all
those based on the Marlin, Prusa, Sprinter and Repetier firmware. It also works
with Mach3, LinuxCNC and Machinekit controllers.

PrusaSlicer is based on [Slic3r](https://github.com/Slic3r/Slic3r) by Alessandro Ranellucci and the RepRap community.

See the [project homepage](https://www.prusa3d.com/slic3r-prusa-edition/) and
the [documentation directory](doc/) for more information.

### Final warning: this code is likely to destroy your print, melt your printer, set your house on fire, and make your wife or husband leave you. The world's end may be hastened, and cats and dogs will live together in an abomination of the natural order.  You have been warned.
